# Namecheap

Register and renew domains with Namecheap

Official domain registrar for [PeltyCMS](https://github.com/MythicalLTD/PeltyCMS).

## Why this addon

Resellers who sell domains next to hosting and need automated register / renew.

## Features

- Availability checks against the official **Namecheap** API
- Register, renew and transfer domains from Pelty orders
- Nameserver and contact updates where the API allows
- TLD costs sync into Pelty pricing
- Sandboxed WASM registrar — credentials stay in the panel

## How it works

1. Install **Namecheap** from the [Mythical marketplace](https://market.mythicalsystems.org/marketplace/product/registrar-namecheap) inside Pelty Admin → Addons.
2. Open Pelty Admin → Domains, connect Namecheap, sync TLDs, and sell domains like any other product.
3. Customers hit checkout / login / order flow as usual — Namecheap runs in the background.

## Requirements

- PeltyCMS with WASM addons enabled
- Working Namecheap credentials
- Outbound HTTPS from your panel

## Get it

**[Namecheap on Mythical Marketplace](https://market.mythicalsystems.org/marketplace/product/registrar-namecheap)**
